-- Neovim's answer to the mouse ðŸ¦˜
-- Leap is a general-purpose motion plugin for Neovim, building and improving 
-- primarily on vim-sneak, with the ultimate goal of establishing a new standard 
-- interface for moving around in the visible area in Vim-like modal editors. It 
-- allows you to reach any target in a very fast, uniform way, and minimizes the 
-- required focus level while executing a jump.
